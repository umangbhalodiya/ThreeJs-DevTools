# three-devtools

**three-devtools** is a web extension that allows inspection of three.js content.

> ## ðŸš¨ Status: Experimental
> **three-devtools** is very much in an alpha/experimentation stage. Use at your own risk. Follow the [Baseline Milestone](https://github.com/jsantell/three-devtools/milestone/1) for issues and considerations that need to be solved in order for some stability.

## Installing

The alpha version of the developer tools can be installed as a web extension on [Firefox Add-ons/AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/three-js-developer-tools/) and for Chrome via [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-developer-tools/ebpnegggocnnhleeicgljbedjkganaek). See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for local installation.

## Current API

This API has not been thought out at all, but this will register your
THREE.Scene and THREE.Renderer to be observed by the tools.

```js
// Observe a scene or a renderer
if (typeof __THREE_DEVTOOLS__ !== 'undefined') {
  __THREE_DEVTOOLS__.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('observe', { detail: scene }));
  __THREE_DEVTOOLS__.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('observe', { detail: renderer }));
}
```

## Development

Architecture & development notes can be found in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
